# LICENCE

The JUCE library itself is licensed according to its own licence agreement (or an alternative agreement you might have with PACE).

The rest of the template code and scripts are released in the public domain. Any acknowledgement of my work is appreciated but not required.

The project may require VST and AAX SDKs for compilation, which come with their own terms and conditions. The automated convenience script will pull the VST SDK; please make sure you are aware of the licensing terms associated with using VST SDK before proceeding.
